# MSc Data Science Student Projects (2021/22)

This repository contains information about project options for [CSC8634 Cloud Computing with Project](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/modules/CSC8634) and [CSC8635 Machine Learning with Project](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/postgraduate/modules/CSC8634).

The handbook and coursework specifications are available within Canvas, which describe the required deliverables for these projects.

The project pages in this Github repository are intended to exist as 'living documents'. Additional resources may be posted to these, as well as a section addressing Frequently Asked Questions. You, the students, are similarly encouraged to contribute useful resources to these pages. You will also find discussion boards available within Canvas to discuss your assignments.

## Project Selection Process

__Important:__ You are strongly encouraged to explore the possible projects, but to fairly quickly determine which project/dataset you will stick with for the project. We suggest you make this final choice by the end of the first week of December at the absolute latest. 

Please complete the following forms at your earliest convenience once you have decided on your project:
- [Project Selection form for CSC8634 Cloud Computing with Project](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yRJQnBa2wkSpF2aBT74-hwF63lPV39hDi3hc4vZSXKZUNDlTNkZIQ1JSUFJWQ0dSSlM2MzNZSE4zNC4u)
- [Project Selection form for CSC8635 Machine Learning with Project](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yRJQnBa2wkSpF2aBT74-hwF63lPV39hDi3hc4vZSXKZUQkwxRkpLSEpLWUZPNUpQNVNVRlJNSlNQMi4u)

Matt will be in touch in late December to follow up with anyone who has not stated their choice.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Matt at matthew.forshaw@ncl.ac.uk.

## CSC8634 Cloud Computing with Project

There exist clear opportunities for increased statistical rigour, and an emphasis on reproducible data analyses, to inform and better work in the "performance evaluation" area of Computer Science research. This is where Data Science can play a key role. The projects presented as part of CSC8634 sit at the intersection of Data Science, Cloud Computing, and performance evaluation research.

The following two project briefs are available for CSC8634.

- [Performance evaluation of Terapixel rendering in Cloud (Super)Computing](TeraScope/Summary.md)
- [Analysis of traffic workloads in Facebook datacentres](FacebookNetworkTraffic/Summary.md) (In collaboration with Oracle Labs, Zurich).

For an excellent introduction to the pitfalls of statistical analysis in the evaluation of large-scale computing systems, I strongly recommend you read the following paper from Hoefler *et al.*

> Hoefler, Torsten, and Roberto Belli. "Scientific benchmarking of parallel computing systems: twelve ways to tell the masses when reporting performance results." In *Proceedings of the international conference for high performance computing, networking, storage and analysis*, p. 73. ACM, 2015. [[paper]](Resources/hoefler-scientific-benchmarking-paper.pdf) [[slides]](Resources/hoefler-scientific-benchmarking_slides.pdf) [[video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNLhvUNaHec&t=0s&index=6&list=PLnftmQ4zqi4QlgnA6X6-7IHuHRsjuEYgZ)

Furthermore, ["How NOT to measure latency"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ8ydIuPFeU&t=1s) from Gil Tene discusses, in a very engaging manner, the perils of interpretation and measurement of latency values in large-scale systems.

If you wish to select a project outside of those specified above, you must contact Matt for approval on matthew.forshaw@ncl.ac.uk.

## CSC8635 Machine Learning with Project

For CSC8635 you are free to select a project of your choice, bringing together data from the likes of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), and other similar sources. 

Yu Guan has suggested the following datasets as being appropriate.
- [Behaviour assessment for Stroke rehabilitation](https://www.kaggle.com/derekdb/toronto-robot-stroke-posture-dataset)
- [Distracted driver detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data)
- [Activity recognition via mobile sensing](https://www.kaggle.com/malekzadeh/motionsense-dataset)
- [Skin cancer image recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)

You are also most welcome to select a dataset from CSC8634 Cloud Computing with Project to use as part of your CSC8635 submission, taking a predictive focus to the work. You may also use the same dataset for each project, so long as you adjust the scope of your deliverables accordingly. If you would like to discuss project scope further, do not hesitate to contact Matt.

If you wish to select a project outside of those specified above, you must contact Matt for approval on matthew.forshaw@ncl.ac.uk.
